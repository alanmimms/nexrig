# Claude Code Session Context

## Project: USB SSB Transceiver - Mock Server & Browser App Development

### Current Session Summary
Working on fixing frequency tuning issues in a Software Defined Radio (SDR) browser application where audio output wasn't changing when tuning frequency was adjusted.

### Problem Solved
**Issue**: Frequency tuning had no effect on audio output - tuning changes didn't produce audible differences in received signals.

**Root Causes Found & Fixed**:
1. **HTML default tuning**: Slider was set to `value="1500"` instead of proper initial value
2. **Phase accumulator timing**: `sampleIndex` was incremented AFTER phase calculation instead of before
3. **AudioWorklet caching**: Module wasn't reloading due to browser cache
4. **Initial tuning frequency**: Was set to 0Hz (no frequency shift) instead of test frequency

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Fixed HTML tuning slider to start at 24500Hz for CW beacon testing
2. Fixed phase accumulator timing in `sdr-processor.js`
3. Added cache-busting to AudioWorklet module loading
4. Added keyboard arrow key support for tuning (Left/Right arrows)
5. Set initial tuning to 24.5kHz to hear 500Hz beat note from 25kHz CW beacon

### Key Files Modified

#### `/home/alan/ham/usb-ssb-txcvr/sw/app/index.html`
- Changed tuning slider: `value="24500"` and display to `+24.5 kHz`

#### `/home/alan/ham/usb-ssb-txcvr/sw/app/js/nexrigApp.js`
- Added keyboard arrow key support for tuning in keydown event handler
- Changed initial tuning from 0Hz to 24500Hz for testing
- Arrow keys now tune frequency up/down by 100Hz steps

#### `/home/alan/ham/usb-ssb-txcvr/sw/app/js/advancedDsp.js`
- Added cache-busting parameter to AudioWorklet module loading
- Changed initial tuning frequency from 1500Hz to 0Hz (later overridden to 24500Hz)

#### `/home/alan/ham/usb-ssb-txcvr/sw/app/js/sdr-processor.js`
- Fixed critical timing bug: moved `this.sampleIndex++` BEFORE phase calculation
- Frequency shifting formula: `phaseIncrement = 2 * π * tuningFreq / iqSampleRate`
- Phase accumulator properly tracks tuning phase for complex multiplication
- Using magnitude detection temporarily for debugging: `audioSample = Math.sqrt(iBaseband² + qBaseband²) * 0.5`

#### `/home/alan/ham/usb-ssb-txcvr/mock-server/src/iqStreamGenerator.js`
- Configured signal sources for testing:
  - USB two-tone signal at 0Hz (baseband center): 700Hz + 1900Hz audio tones  
  - CW beacon at +25kHz: continuous carrier for beat note testing
- CW beacon temporarily set to continuous carrier (`return true`) for debugging

### Technical Architecture
- **Mock Server**: Provides wide baseband I/Q data (±48kHz range) via WebSocket
- **Browser DSP**: AudioWorklet processor performs frequency-selective demodulation
- **Frequency Shifting**: Complex multiplication to mix desired frequency to baseband
- **Sample Rates**: 96kS/s I/Q input, 48kS/s audio output, 2:1 decimation

### Expected Behavior After Fixes
1. **Initial State**: Tuned to 24.5kHz, should hear 500Hz tone from CW beacon
2. **Frequency Tuning**: Arrow keys change frequency, audio should change accordingly
3. **Debug Output**: Should show non-zero phase increments and varying cos/sin values
4. **Signal Reception**: 
   - At 0Hz: Hear USB two-tone signal (700Hz + 1900Hz)
   - At 24.5kHz: Hear 500Hz beat note from 25kHz CW beacon
   - At other frequencies: Hear noise or other signals

### Debug Commands
- `cd /home/alan/ham/usb-ssb-txcvr/mock-server && npm run dev` - Start mock server
- Open `http://localhost:3000/app/` in browser
- Use Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh (cache-busting)
- Check browser console for AudioWorklet debug messages
- Use Left/Right arrow keys to tune frequency

### Next Steps if Issues Persist
1. Verify AudioWorklet debug shows non-zero phase increments
2. Check that tuning changes are reflected in debug output  
3. Test different frequencies to confirm frequency-selective reception
4. Switch from magnitude detection back to proper SSB demodulation
5. Verify CW beacon timing and Morse code generation

### Issues Fixed

#### Audio Buzzing Problem (RESOLVED - Final Fix)
- **Issue**: Clean audio for first ~100ms, then continuous buzzing
- **Root Cause**: Timing mismatch between I/Q production (96kS/s) and audio consumption (48kS/s)
- **Previous Attempts**:
  - Removed buffer thresholds (helped but didn't eliminate buzzing)
  - Fixed undefined variable `samplesToProcess` in debug messages
- **Final Solution**: Implemented fractional resampler with linear interpolation
  - Precise phase tracking advances by exactly 2.0 per audio sample
  - Linear interpolation between I/Q samples eliminates aliasing
  - Perfect sample rate conversion handles any timing precision differences
- **Technical Details**: `sdr-processor.js` lines 31-33, 128-186

#### WASM Integration Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: "importScripts is not defined" error when loading WASM in AudioWorklet
- **Root Cause**: importScripts only available during AudioWorklet execution, not module load time
- **Solution**: Reverted to pure JavaScript DSP implementation for now
- **Future**: Need alternative WASM loading method compatible with AudioWorklet constraints

### CRITICAL Timing Architecture (IMPORTANT)
**The audio consumption rate is the ONLY thing in this system that should be timed on the browser side.**

- Audio AudioWorklet drains the I/Q buffer at its natural rate (48kS/s after 2:1 decimation)
- Buffer is filled by incoming I/Q samples from WebSocket at 96kS/s
- Mock server timing is NOT constrained by browser audio drain rate
- Mock server simulates a radio producing I/Q samples at fixed 96kS/s rate
- No browser-side timers needed except for mock server to generate samples at radio rate
- Audio consumption provides the sole source of timing control on browser side
- This master/slave relationship: audio drain is master, I/Q production follows radio rate

### Current DSP Implementation Status (Updated)
**Current State**: Pure JavaScript DSP implementation - WASM reverted due to loading issues
- `advancedDsp.js`: Coordinates AudioWorklet and handles I/Q data routing
- `sdr-processor.js`: AudioWorklet processor doing DSP in pure JavaScript
- Basic operations: Simple decimation (2:1), SSB/AM demodulation, Hilbert transforms, AGC
- **WASM Files Created**: `sdr_dsp.c`, `wasmDspWrapper.js` - ready for future integration
- **WASM Status**: Compiled successfully but importScripts incompatible with AudioWorklet loading

### WASM DSP Integration Plan (Recommended)
**Ideal Architecture**: AudioWorklet + WASM for high-performance browser SDR
- AudioWorklet provides real-time audio thread scheduling
- WASM provides high-performance DSP operations (complex math, filtering, demodulation)
- Combine for optimal performance: AudioWorklet timing + WASM computation speed

**Implementation Steps for Future WASM Integration**:
1. **Alternative WASM Loading**: Use different approach than importScripts:
   - Pre-load WASM module in main thread, pass to AudioWorklet via message
   - Use dynamic import() with blob URLs for AudioWorklet-compatible loading
   - Initialize WASM inside AudioWorklet constructor after successful loading
2. **WASM DSP Functions**: Already created in `sdr_dsp.c`:
   - High-performance FIR/IIR filtering and Hilbert transforms
   - SSB/LSB/AM demodulation algorithms
   - Combined decimation + demodulation processing
   - Memory management functions for WASM heap
3. **Integration Points**: Replace JavaScript DSP in `sdr-processor.js`:
   - Replace `hilbertTransform()` with WASM version
   - Replace demodulation switch statement with `processIqBlock()`
   - Maintain AudioWorklet for real-time scheduling and audio output

#### Key Files for Buffer Issue
- `sw/app/js/sdr-processor.js` - AudioWorklet processor, main DSP logic
- `mock-server/src/server.js` - WebSocket I/Q streaming at exactly 96kS/s
- `mock-server/src/iqStreamGenerator.js` - Mock I/Q signal generation
- `sw/app/js/advancedDsp.js` - DSP coordination and AudioWorklet management

### Recent Console Output Analysis
Last debug output showed `Tune=0Hz` with `phaseInc=0.000000`, indicating the frequency shifting fix worked but tuning was still at 0Hz. After setting to 24.5kHz, should now see proper phase increment values around 1.604 radians.
