This is the exact circuit topology that the Python script calculates for:

COMPONENT FUNCTIONS:
===================

1. INPUT MATCHING (Tapped Capacitor Network):
   - C_hot (202.4pF): Series capacitor providing impedance transformation and external coupling
   - C_cold (101.2pF): Shunt capacitor to ground, completes the impedance matching
   - Ratio C_hot/C_cold ≈ 2:1 provides 50Ω to ~100Ω transformation

2. TANK RESONATORS (3x identical):
   - L1,L2,L3 (1000nH each): Tank inductors
   - C1,C2,C3 (101.4pF each): Tank capacitors, all resonate at f₀ = 15.8MHz
   - Each tank has impedance ≈ 99Ω at resonance

3. INTER-RESONATOR COUPLING:
   - C12, C23 (20.1pF each): Coupling capacitors between adjacent resonators
   - Provide the required coupling coefficient k ≈ 0.199 for Chebyshev response

4. OUTPUT MATCHING (Mirror of Input):
   - Same tapped-capacitor configuration as input
   - Provides 50Ω matching and proper termination

KEY DESIGN POINTS:
==================

• All tank resonators tuned to same frequency (15.8 MHz)
• Coupling strength determined by C12, C23 values
• Input/output matching uses tapped-C topology (NOT simple L-networks)
• Impedance transformation AND external coupling done simultaneously
• 2:1 capacitor ratio in matching networks is critical

COMPARISON WITH YOUR SCHEMATIC:
===============================

Check if your KiCad schematic has:
1. ✓ Three identical LC tanks (L=1000nH, C≈101pF)
2. ✓ Small coupling caps between tanks (≈20pF)  
3. ✓ Tapped capacitor input/output matching
4. ✓ 2:1 ratio in matching capacitors (≈202pF and ≈101pF)
5. ? Are both matching caps in SERIES path or is one shunt to ground?

The most common error is having the wrong matching network topology.
The Python script assumes TAPPED capacitors, not L-networks.
