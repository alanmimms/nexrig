COMPONENT REFERENCE (matches your schematic):
============================================

INPUT MATCHING:
- C_hot_in  = 202.4pF  (C7951 in your schematic ≈ 202.8pF) ✓
- C_cold_in = 101.2pF  (C7974 in your schematic ≈ 100.71pF) ✓

TANK RESONATORS:
- L1 = 1000nH (L7805 in your schematic = 1uH) ✓
- L2 = 1000nH (L7807 in your schematic = 1uH) ✓  
- L3 = 1000nH (L7809 in your schematic = 1uH) ✓
- C1 = 101.4pF (Tank capacitor, resonates with L1 at 15.8MHz)
- C2 = 101.4pF (Tank capacitor, resonates with L2 at 15.8MHz)
- C3 = 101.4pF (Tank capacitor, resonates with L3 at 15.8MHz)

COUPLING CAPACITORS:
- C12 = 20.1pF (C7936 in your schematic ≈ 20.147pF) ✓
- C23 = 20.1pF (C7933 in your schematic ≈ 20.147pF) ✓

OUTPUT MATCHING:
- C_cold_out = 101.2pF (C7940 in your schematic ≈ 100.71pF) ✓
- C_hot_out  = 202.4pF (C7939 in your schematic ≈ 202.8pF) ✓


CRITICAL TOPOLOGY POINTS:
========================

1. TAPPED CAPACITOR MATCHING:
   - C_hot is in SERIES with the signal path
   - C_cold is SHUNT to ground from the tap point
   - The tap point is between C_hot and the tank
   - This creates both impedance matching AND external coupling

2. TANK CONNECTIONS:
   - Each tank is L in parallel with C
   - All tanks resonate at the same frequency (15.8MHz)
   - All tank grounds must be connected together

3. COUPLING:
   - C12 couples Tank1 to Tank2
   - C23 couples Tank2 to Tank3
   - Coupling caps are small (20pF) compared to tank caps (101pF)

4. SIGNAL PATH:
   INPUT → Rin → C_hot_in → [tap] → Tank1 → C12 → Tank2 → C23 → Tank3 → [tap] → C_hot_out → Rload → OUTPUT

                  C_cold_in                                                      C_cold_out
                     |                                                                |
                    GND                                                              GND


VERIFICATION CHECKLIST FOR YOUR SCHEMATIC:
=========================================

□ Input source has 50Ω series resistance
□ C_hot_in (202.8pF) is in series with signal path
□ C_cold_in (100.71pF) connects from tap point to ground
□ Tank 1: L7805 (1000nH) || C1 (101.4pF), both to ground
□ C12 (20.147pF) connects Tank 1 to Tank 2
□ Tank 2: L7807 (1000nH) || C2 (101.4pF), both to ground  
□ C23 (20.147pF) connects Tank 2 to Tank 3
□ Tank 3: L7809 (1000nH) || C3 (101.4pF), both to ground
□ C_cold_out (100.71pF) connects from tap point to ground
□ C_hot_out (202.8pF) is in series to 50Ω load
□ All grounds are connected together
□ No floating nodes or missing connections

COMMON ERRORS THAT CAUSE BAD SIMULATION:
=======================================

1. C_cold not connected to ground (floating shunt cap)
2. Wrong tap point location
3. Missing ground connections between tanks
4. Coupling caps in wrong locations
5. Wrong simulation frequency range
6. Probing wrong node for output
7. AC source amplitude or phase issues
8. Component parasitics not modeled correctly

If your schematic matches this topology exactly and you still get bad simulation,
the issue is likely in the simulation setup, not the circuit design.
