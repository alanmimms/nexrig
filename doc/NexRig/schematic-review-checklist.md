# NexRig Schematic Review Checklist

## Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive checklist for reviewing NexRig schematics to ensure design correctness, completeness, and manufacturability. Use this for both progressive reviews during schematic entry and final validation before PCB layout.

## Review Process Overview

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **First Pass**: Connectivity and basic electrical rules (automated + manual)
2. **Second Pass**: Component specifications and ratings
3. **Third Pass**: Subsystem-specific verification against architecture docs
4. **Fourth Pass**: Debug provisions and manufacturing considerations
5. **Final Pass**: Cross-sheet consistency and documentation completeness

**Severity Levels:**
- ğŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Design will not function or may be damaged
- ğŸŸ¡ **WARNING**: May cause intermittent issues or suboptimal performance
- ğŸŸ¢ **OPTIMIZATION**: Works but could be improved
