## Document Overview

This document specifies the complete component selection for the NexRig 50W HF transmitter PA tank circuit operating at 200Ω system impedance. All inductors use off-the-shelf parts (Coilcraft and Bourns), and capacitor values are optimized for the 200Ω domain.

**Key Design Parameters:**

- System impedance: 200Ω
- Power level: 50W (141V peak, 0.5A RMS)
- Target Q: ≤20 (controlled via series resistors)
- Frequency coverage: All HF amateur bands (1.8-29.7 MHz)

L3: 276 nH ±5% (262-290 nH)

Parallel inductance formula:
L_parallel = (L2 × L3) / (L2 + L3)

Worst case combinations:
Minimum L: (674 × 262) / (674 + 262) = 188.7 nH

Deviation: +1.4% (excellent match)
```

**Implementation:**

- Both K2 and K3 relay switches closed (energized)
- Both inductors connect to hot RF node simultaneously
- Series resistors for both inductors remain in circuit

## 2. Series Resistors for Q Control

All inductors require series resistors to reduce Q from >60 to target Q≤20.

### 2.1 General Requirements

**Resistor specifications:**

- Type: Metal film (NOT wirewound - causes RF inductance)

- Tolerance: ±1% for good parallel matching
- Temperature coefficient: ±100 ppm/°C typical (positive TC)
- Package: Axial through-hole for heat dissipation
- Voltage rating: Not critical (low voltage drop)

**Why parallel resistors:**

- Distributes power dissipation across multiple components
- Lower temperature rise per component (~30-40°C vs 80-100°C)
- Positive temperature coefficient provides negative feedback (stable)
- No thermal runaway risk
- Better reliability

---

### 2.2 L1 Series Resistor

Inductor DCR: ~0.5Ω

Required total resistance for Q=20:
R_total = ωL/Q = (2π × 3.5MHz × 2.0µH) / 20 = 2.20Ω

Series R needed:
R_series = 2.20Ω - 0.5Ω = 1.7Ω

Power dissipation:
P = I² × R = (0.5A)² × 1.7Ω = 0.425W
```

**Implementation: Three 5.1Ω resistors in parallel**

```
Configuration: 3× 5.1Ω in parallel
Total resistance: 5.1Ω / 3 = 1.7Ω ✓
Power per resistor: 0.425W / 3 = 0.142W each
Temperature rise: ~25-30°C per resistor

```
Inductance: 709 nH nominal
Operating frequency: 7-18 MHz
Inductor Q @ 14 MHz: ~80-100 estimated
Inductor DCR: 0.0827Ω

Required total resistance for Q=20:
R_total = (2π × 14MHz × 709nH) / 20 = 3.12Ω

Series R needed:
R_series = 3.12Ω - 0.0827Ω ≈ 3.04Ω

Power dissipation:
P = (0.5A)² × 3.04Ω = 0.76W
```

**Implementation: Four 12Ω resistors in parallel**

```
Configuration: 4× 12Ω in parallel

```

---

### 2.4 L3 Series Resistor

**Target Q = 20 at 18 MHz (17m)**

```
Inductance: 276 nH nominal
Operating frequency: 18.068-18.168 MHz
Inductor Q: ~70-100 estimated
Inductor DCR: 0.0225Ω

Required total resistance for Q=20:
R_total = (2π × 18MHz × 276nH) / 20 = 1.56Ω

Series R needed:
R_series = 1.56Ω - 0.0225Ω ≈ 1.54Ω

Power dissipation:
P = (0.5A)² × 1.54Ω = 0.385W
```

**Implementation: Two 3.0Ω resistors in parallel**

```
Configuration: 2× 3.0Ω in parallel
Total resistance: 3.0Ω / 2 = 1.5Ω ✓
Power per resistor: 0.385W / 2 = 0.19W each
Temperature rise: ~30-35°C per resistor
Margin: 3.2× power rating margin

Component: Vishay MRS25 or equivalent
- 3.0Ω ±1% metal film
- 0.6W rated
- Through-hole axial
- Cost: ~$0.10 each × 2 = $0.20
```

**Note for parallel operation (15m/12m/10m):** When L2 and L3 are paralleled, both series resistors remain in circuit. The effective series resistance is ~1.0Ω (R2‖R3), giving slightly lower Q which is acceptable for high bands.

## 3. Capacitor Bank Architecture

### 3.1 Binary-Weighted Capacitor Bank (9-bit)

**Complete bank specification:**

|Bit|Value (pF)|Paralleling|Voltage|Type|Switch|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|C0 (LSB)|4|1× 4pF|3kV|C0G|SMP1302|$0.20|
|C1|8|2× 4pF|3kV|C0G|SMP1302|$0.40|
|C2|16|4× 4pF|3kV|C0G|SMP1302|$0.80|
|C3|32|1× 32pF|3kV|C0G|SMP1302|$0.50|
|C4|64|2× 32pF|3kV|C0G|SMP1302|$1.00|
|C5|128|4× 32pF|3kV|C0G|MA4P4002B|$2.00|
|C6|256|8× 32pF|3kV|C0G|MA4P4002B|$4.00|
|C7|512|16× 32pF|3kV|C0G|MA4P4002B|$8.00|
|C8 (MSB)|1536|48× 32pF|3kV|C0G|MA4P4002B|$24.00|

**Total range:** 0 to 2,556 pF in variable steps (4 pF minimum) **Maximum capacitance:** All bits ON = 4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512+1536 = 2,556 pF **Parasitic capacitance:** ~2.4 pF (13 switches × ~0.18pF each) **Effective range:** 2.4 to 2,558.4 pF

**Note on C8 value:** C8 = 1536 pF is intentionally non-binary (should be 1024 pF for pure binary). This extends the total range from 1023 pF to 2556 pF, providing better coverage for low bands without requiring a 10th bit.

### 3.2 Fixed Capacitor for 160m

**Part specification:**

```
Value: 2200 pF (2.2 nF)
Voltage rating: 3kV C0G/NP0
Composition: Multiple capacitors in parallel for current handling
Implementation options:
  Option A: 4× 560pF in parallel (standard E12 values)
  Option B: 2× 1000pF + 1× 220pF in parallel

Switching: SPDT reed relay (Coto 9011-05-10 or equivalent)
Control: Single GPIO from STM32
Cost: ~$3 (capacitors) + $8 (relay) = $11

Active only for 160m band
All other bands use binary bank only
```

**Why 2200 pF:**

- Provides base capacitance for 160m range (2870-4332 pF needed)
- With binary bank (0-2556 pF), total range is 2200-4756 pF ✓
- Covers full 160m band with all L1 tolerance variations
- Standard value, easy to source

Package: SOD-323F (SMD)
Cost: ~$5 each × 4 = $20 total
```

**Total capacitor switching cost:** $25 (9 PIN diodes)

---

### 3.4 PIN Diode Bias Circuit

**Complementary MOSFET pair per PIN:**

```
Part: Nexperia 2N7002AKRA-QZ
Description: Dual N+P channel MOSFET in single package
Package: SC-70-6
Quantity: 9 (one per capacitor bit)
Cost: ~$0.35 each × 9 = $3.15

Circuit per PIN diode:

            GND          [10kΩ]       GND
                         Pull-down

Control (single GPIO per PIN):
GPIO = LOW  (0V):   P-FET ON,  N-FET OFF → Forward bias (~38mA)
GPIO = HIGH (3.3V): P-FET OFF, N-FET ON  → Reverse bias (RF provides -V)

Components per PIN:
1× 2N7002AKRA-QZ (complementary pair)
1× 68Ω resistor (current limit)
1× 10kΩ resistor (pull-down)

Total bias circuit cost: ~$4.50 for all 9 PINs
```

**Why no negative supply needed:** The 141V peak RF swing provides far more than adequate reverse bias (typical PIN needs only 10-20V). Using 0V (GND) for OFF state and +3.3V for ON state works perfectly for both PIN types.

## 4. Band-by-Band Component Selection

### 4.1 Calculation Methodology

**Resonance formula:**

```
f = 1 / (2π√(LC))

Solving for C:
C = 1 / ((2πf)² × L)
```

**Tolerance stacking:** For each band, calculate capacitance range considering:

- Minimum L value (low tolerance limit)
- Maximum L value (high tolerance limit)
- Minimum frequency (low end of band)
- Maximum frequency (high end of band)

This gives four corner cases; the capacitance range must span from minimum to maximum across all cases.

## 8. Calibration Strategy

### 8.1 Per-Unit Factory Calibration

**Goal:** Create frequency-to-capacitance lookup table for each band, compensating for all real-world variations.

**Process:**

```
For each band:
  1. Select appropriate inductor(s) via relay control
  2. If 160m, enable fixed 2200 pF capacitor
  3. Step through binary capacitor values (0-2556 pF)
  4. For each capacitor setting:
     - Transmit -40 dBm calibration tone (safe, Part 15 compliant)
     - Measure actual output frequency via receiver feedback path
     - Record: [binary_value → actual_frequency]
  5. Fit polynomial or build lookup table
  6. Store calibration coefficients in non-volatile memory

Total calibration time: ~5-10 minutes per transceiver
Can be automated for production
```

**What calibration compensates:**

```
✓ Inductor tolerance (±5% to ±10%)
✓ Capacitor tolerance (typically ±5% for C0G)
✓ PCB trace parasitic capacitance (~2.4 pF)
✓ PIN diode OFF-state capacitance (~0.3 pF each × 9)
✓ Reed relay contact capacitance
✓ Temperature effects (can recalibrate at runtime)
✓ Component aging over time

Result: <1 kHz frequency accuracy across all bands ✓✓✓
```

### 8.2 Runtime Operation

**Frequency setting procedure:**

```
User requests frequency f on band B:
  1. Load calibration coefficients for band B
  2. Apply inverse function: f → binary_capacitor_value
  3. Set inductor relays for band B
  4. Set fixed cap relay if band = 160m
  5. Set binary bank to calculated value
  6. PA resonates at exact frequency f

Adjustment speed: <1 ms (PIN diodes fast)
Frequency accuracy: <1 kHz typical
```

### 8.3 Temperature Compensation (Optional)

**For improved stability:**

```
Add temperature sensor near tank circuit
Characterize frequency drift vs temperature
Apply correction coefficients in real-time

Expected drift without compensation:
~50 ppm/°C typical for C0G capacitors
At 14 MHz: 700 Hz per °C

With compensation: <100 Hz drift over full range
```

## 10. PCB Layout Guidelines

### 10.1 Critical Layout Considerations

**Hot RF bus:**

```
Trace width: 0.5mm minimum for current
Clearance to GND: 0.5mm minimum (350V isolation)
Routing: Keep short, direct paths
No vias under hot nodes (stress concentration)
```

**Ground plane:**

```
Solid copper pour under entire tank circuit
Stitching vias: Every 5-10mm around perimeter
2 oz copper minimum for thermal management
```

**Component placement:**

```
Linear arrangement: [PA] → [L bank] → [C bank] → [DC block] → [to LPF]
Inductor relays: Adjacent to inductors
Binary bank: Organized by bit value
PIN diodes: Close to capacitors (minimize trace length)
Series resistors: Between inductor and hot bus
```

**Thermal management:**

```
Series resistors: Adequate spacing (10mm between)
PIN diodes C5-C8: Heat spreading copper pours
All ground connections: Multiple vias for heat sinking
Natural convection adequate (no forced air needed)
```

### 10.2 Expected Temperature Rise

```
Series resistors: +30-40°C above ambient
PIN diodes (high current): +30-35°C above ambient
All within component ratings (125°C typical) ✓
Maximum component temperature: ~65°C in 25°C ambient
```

## 12. Troubleshooting Guide

### 12.1 Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Cannot tune to band edges**

```
Symptom: Calibration fails at frequency extremes
Cause: Capacitor range insufficient

Check:
1. Verify all binary bits functioning
2. Measure actual inductor value (may be out of spec)
3. Check for parasitic capacitance (should be ~2.4 pF)

Solution:
- If L1 out of spec: Replace or adjust fixed cap
- If binary bits stuck: Check PIN bias circuit
- If excessive parasitics: Review PCB layout
```

**Issue: Poor efficiency on specific band**

```
Symptom: Lower than expected output power
Cause: High resistance in tank circuit

Check:
1. Relay contact resistance (<0.5Ω)
2. PIN diode forward bias current (35-45mA)
3. Series resistor values (correct for each inductor)
4. Solder joints (cold solder adds resistance)

Solution:
- Clean relay contacts (cycle multiple times)
- Verify MOSFET bias circuit functioning
- Measure actual Q (should be ~20)
- Reflow suspected solder joints
```

**Issue: Frequency instability**

```
Symptom: Frequency drifts with temperature
Cause: Insufficient temperature compensation

Check:
1. Capacitor type (must be C0G, not X7R)
2. PIN diode bias stability
3. Inductor temperature coefficient

Solution:
- Replace any non-C0G capacitors immediately
- Add temperature compensation in software
- Verify stable bias voltage (3.3V regulated)
```

**Issue: Spurious resonances**

```
Symptom: Multiple dips in VNA sweep
Cause: Parasitic resonances from unused components

Check:
1. Inactive inductors properly grounded (relay NC contact)
2. Inactive capacitors fully shorted (PIN reverse biased)
3. PCB trace lengths (keep short)

Solution:
- Verify relay switching (should ground unused components)
- Check PIN reverse bias voltage (0V correct)
- Add small damping resistors if needed (10-50Ω)
```

## 13. Design Trade-offs and Alternatives

### 13.1 Decisions Made

**Off-shelf inductors vs hand-wound:**

- **Chose:** Off-shelf (Coilcraft, Bourns)
- **Reason:** Zero labor, consistent performance, excellent SRF
- **Trade-off:** Slightly higher cost ($5.70 vs ~$3.00 hand-wound)
- **Verdict:** Worth it for production scalability ✓

**9-bit vs 8-bit capacitor bank:**

- **Chose:** 9-bit with C8 = 1536 pF (non-binary)
- **Reason:** Extends range to 2556 pF, covers all bands
- **Trade-off:** One extra PIN + MOSFET + GPIO
- **Verdict:** Simpler than adding multiple fixed caps ✓

**Metal film resistors in parallel:**

- **Chose:** 2-4 resistors per inductor
- **Reason:** Power distribution, thermal management
- **Trade-off:** More components to place
- **Verdict:** Better reliability and no thermal runaway ✓

**Q = 20 target:**

- **Chose:** Series resistors to limit Q
- **Reason:** Manageable tank voltages, easier tuning
- **Trade-off:** ~3% power loss in resistors (1.5W total)
- **Verdict:** Acceptable for 50W system ✓

### 13.2 Alternative Approaches Not Taken

**Higher Q (Q=30-50):**

- Would require higher voltage capacitors (>5kV)
- More critical tuning precision needed
- Minimal efficiency gain
- **Rejected:** Not worth complexity

**Continuously variable capacitor (varactor):**

- Would eliminate binary switching complexity
- But: Poor Q at HF, nonlinear, temperature sensitive
- **Rejected:** Switched capacitors more predictable

**Separate fixed caps per band:**

- Could use smaller binary bank (5-6 bits)
- But: 9 relays needed vs current 4 relays
- **Rejected:** More complex control, higher cost

## Appendix A: Calculation Formulas

### A.1 Resonant Frequency

```
f = 1 / (2π√(LC))

Where:
f = frequency (Hz)
L = inductance (H)
C = capacitance (F)
```

### A.2 Required Capacitance

```
C = 1 / ((2πf)² × L)

Example:
f = 7.0 MHz
L = 720 nH

C = 1 / ((2π × 7.0×10⁶)² × 720×10⁻⁹)
C = 1 / (1.936×10⁹ × 720×10⁻⁹)
C = 1 / 1.394×10⁻³
C = 717 pF
```

### A.3 Parallel Inductance

```
L_parallel = (L1 × L2) / (L1 + L2)

Example:
L1 = 709 nH
L2 = 276 nH

L_parallel = (709 × 276) / (709 + 276)
L_parallel = 195,684 / 985
L_parallel = 198.7 nH
```

### A.4 Tank Q Factor

```
Q = ωL / R = (2πfL) / R

Where:
Q = quality factor (dimensionless)
ω = angular frequency (rad/s)
f = frequency (Hz)
L = inductance (H)
R = total series resistance (Ω)

Example:
f = 14 MHz
L = 720 nH
R = 3.0Ω (series resistor + DCR)

Q = (2π × 14×10⁶ × 720×10⁻⁹) / 3.0
Q = 0.0633 / 3.0
Q = 21.1 (close to target 20)
```

### A.5 Capacitor Current

```
I_C = V × (2πfC)

Where:
I_C = RMS current through capacitor (A)
V = RMS voltage across capacitor (V)
f = frequency (Hz)
C = capacitance (F)

Example:
V = 100V RMS
f = 7 MHz
C = 128 pF

I_C = 100 × (2π × 7×10⁶ × 128×10⁻¹²)
I_C = 100 × 5.63×10⁻³
I_C = 0.563 A RMS

This determines PIN diode current rating
```

### A.6 Power Dissipation in Series Resistor

```
P = I² × R

Where:
P = power dissipation (W)
I = RMS current (A)
R = resistance (Ω)

Example:
I = 0.5A RMS
R = 3.0Ω

P = (0.5)² × 3.0
P = 0.25 × 3.0
P = 0.75W

Requires 2W resistor or paralleled resistors
