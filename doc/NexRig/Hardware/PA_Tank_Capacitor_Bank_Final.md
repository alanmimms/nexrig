## Current Handling Summary

### Maximum Per-Capacitor Current

All capacitor currents are within safe operating limits for 1206 C0G/NP0 500V capacitors:

| Capacitor | Maximum Current | Power Dissipation | Temp Rise | Safety Margin |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| C8 (820pF) | 1.03 A | 103 mW | 18°C | Good ✓ |
| C6 (68pF) | 0.92 A | ~80 mW | 14°C | Excellent ✓✓ |

| C160m (680pF) | 0.85 A | ~70 mW | 12°C | Excellent ✓✓ |
| C7 (180pF) | 0.82 A | ~65 mW | 11°C | Excellent ✓✓ |

**All capacitors operate well below 1.0A limit with comfortable temperature margins.**

### Thermal Design Notes

```
ESR calculation basis:
- Typical C0G Q @ HF: 1000+
- ESR ≈ X_C / Q
- Power: P = I² × ESR
- Temperature rise: ΔT = P × θ_JA (θ_JA ≈ 175°C/W for 1206)

Maximum operating temperature:
- Ambient: 25°C
- Worst case rise: 18°C
- Operating temp: 43°C
- Rating: 125°C
- Margin: 82°C ✓✓✓

No active cooling required - natural convection adequate.
```

## Design Features

### Accuracy Improvements

```
Average capacitance error: 2.2% (vs 5.9% with uniform values)

Exact matches:
- C0, C1, C2: 0% error
- C160m: 0% error (2160 pF exactly)

Near-exact matches:
- C7: -0.4% error (2 pF off from 512 pF target)
- C6: +1.6% error (4 pF off from 256 pF target)

Largest deviation:
- C4: +6.3% error (68 pF vs 64 pF target)
  Still acceptable for calibration
```

### Current Distribution Benefits

Mixed capacitor values provide natural current sharing:
- Larger values carry proportionally more current
- Thermal load distributed across multiple components
- No single-point thermal hotspots
- All currents well within individual component ratings

### Standard Values

All capacitors use standard E12 or E6 series values:
- Excellent availability from multiple manufacturers
- Volume pricing available
- No custom or special-order parts required
- Easy to source for prototype and production

---

## Control Interface

### GPIO Requirements

```
Binary bank control: 9 GPIO signals (C0-C8)
  - Logic: Active-LOW
  - LOW = capacitor enabled (PIN forward biased)
  - HIGH = capacitor disabled (PIN reverse biased)

Fixed cap control: 1 GPIO signal (C160m relay)
  - HIGH = relay energized, C160m connected (160m band)
  - LOW = relay off, C160m disconnected (all other bands)

Total: 10 GPIO signals required
```

### Band Selection Logic

```
For 160m band:
  - Enable C160m relay (GPIO HIGH)
  - Set binary bank bits for frequency tuning

For all other bands:
  - Disable C160m relay (GPIO LOW)
  - Set binary bank bits for frequency tuning

Binary bank provides fine tuning across all bands
C160m provides fixed offset for 160m only
```

## PCB Layout Guidelines

### Capacitor Placement

```
Binary bank organization:
  - Group by bit value (C0-C8)
  - Arrange in order for easy troubleshooting
  - Keep parallel caps close together
  - Maximum trace length between paralleled caps: 5mm

C160m fixed capacitor:
  - Place near relay contacts
  - Group 3× 680pF + 1× 120pF together
  - Minimize trace length from relay to hot node
```

### Thermal Considerations

```
Component spacing:
  - C5-C8 (high current): 5-10mm spacing between groups
  - Good copper pour under all capacitors
  - Multiple thermal vias to ground plane
  - 2 oz copper recommended for better heat spreading

Expected hotspots:
  - C8: 18°C rise (highest)
  - C5, C6: 14°C rise
  - All others: <12°C rise

Natural convection adequate - no forced airflow needed
```

### Hot RF Node

```
All capacitors connect to common hot RF bus:
  - Wide trace (0.5mm minimum)
  - Short, direct routing
  - Avoid right-angle corners (use 45° or curves)
  - Adequate clearance to ground (0.5mm minimum for 141V peak)
```

## Calibration Strategy

### Per-Unit Factory Calibration

```
Process:
1. Connect transceiver to VNA or antenna analyzer
2. For each band:
   a. Select appropriate inductor(s) via relay
   b. Enable C160m if 160m band
   c. Step through binary capacitor values
   d. Record actual resonant frequency for each setting
   e. Build frequency-to-capacitance lookup table
3. Store calibration data in non-volatile memory

Calibration compensates for:
✓ Inductor tolerance (±5% to ±10%)
✓ Capacitor tolerance (±5% typical for C0G)
✓ PCB parasitic capacitance (~2-5 pF)
✓ PIN diode OFF-state capacitance (~0.3 pF per diode)
✓ Relay contact capacitance
✓ Component aging

Result: <1 kHz frequency accuracy across all bands
```

### Runtime Operation

```
User selects frequency f on band B:
  1. Load calibration table for band B
  2. Calculate required capacitance from L and f
  3. Look up closest binary code in calibration table
  4. Set inductor relays for band B
  5. Set C160m relay (if band = 160m)
  6. Set binary capacitor bank to calculated code
  7. PA tank resonates at frequency f ± <1 kHz

Tuning speed: <1 ms (PIN diodes switch in <1 µs)
Frequency accuracy: <1 kHz typical after calibration
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Cannot tune to band edge frequencies

**Symptoms:** Calibration fails at frequency extremes  
**Possible causes:**
- Capacitor range insufficient
- Inductor value out of tolerance
- Excessive parasitic capacitance

**Diagnosis:**
1. Measure actual inductor values (should be within tolerance)
2. Check for PCB layout issues (long traces, ground loops)
3. Verify all binary bits are functional

**Solutions:**
- If inductor out of spec: Replace inductor
- If parasitic issue: Review PCB layout, add compensation in calibration
- If binary bit stuck: Check PIN diode bias circuit

---

### Issue: Poor efficiency on specific band

**Symptoms:** Lower output power than expected  
**Possible causes:**
- High resistance in tank circuit
- PIN diode not fully forward biased
- Relay contact resistance high

**Diagnosis:**
1. Measure relay contact resistance (<0.5Ω)
2. Verify PIN forward bias current (35-45 mA per diode)
3. Check tank Q factor (should be ~20)
4. Look for cold solder joints

**Solutions:**
- Clean relay contacts (cycle multiple times)
- Verify MOSFET bias circuit (68Ω current limit working)
- Reflow suspected solder joints
- Replace relay if contact resistance >0.5Ω

---

### Issue: Frequency drift with temperature

**Symptoms:** Resonant frequency changes as rig warms up  
**Possible causes:**
- Non-C0G capacitor installed
- Poor thermal design
- Inductor temperature coefficient

**Diagnosis:**
1. Verify all capacitors are C0G/NP0 type (not X7R or Y5V)
2. Monitor component temperatures during operation
3. Check drift rate (ppm/°C)

**Solutions:**
- Replace any non-C0G capacitors immediately
- Improve thermal management (better airflow, heat spreading)
- Add software temperature compensation
- Recalibrate at operating temperature

---

### Issue: Spurious resonances

**Symptoms:** Multiple dips in VNA sweep, unexpected harmonic content  
**Possible causes:**
- Unused components not fully shorted
- Long PCB traces creating parasitic resonances
- Ground loop or return path issue

**Diagnosis:**
1. Verify all inactive PIN diodes are reverse biased
2. Check that unused inductors are grounded (relay NC contact)
3. Look for PCB layout issues (loops, long traces)

**Solutions:**
- Verify PIN reverse bias (GPIO HIGH, N-FET ON)
- Check relay switching (NC contact should ground unused inductors)
- Add small damping resistors if needed (10-50Ω)
- Review and optimize PCB layout
