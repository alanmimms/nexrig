## Environmental and Operating Specifications

### Temperature Grade ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS DOCUMENTATION
**Issue**: Project temperature specification not documented in architecture

**Decision**:

- Not industrial extended range

**Rationale**:
- Target application: Amateur radio station (indoor, climate-controlled environment)
- Cost optimization (commercial parts are less expensive)
- Adequate for typical operating conditions

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add to PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md (environmental specifications section)
- [ ] Add to BOM-AND-SOURCING.md (component selection criteria)
- [ ] Add to schematic review checklist (verify all parts meet this spec)
- [ ] Verify all selected components meet 0¬∞C to +70¬∞C rating

## Critical Design Conflicts

### EER Controller IC Conflict üî¥ CRITICAL - MUST RESOLVE
**Issue**: Two different controller ICs specified in documentation

**Conflicting Information**:
1. **Tx EER.md** (detailed design document):
   - Specifies: Texas Instruments **LM34936**
   - Topology: 4-switch synchronous buck-boost
   - Switching frequency: 500 kHz (set by 15kŒ© RT resistor)
   - Detailed component specifications provided
   
2. **EER phase modulation.md** (transmitter overview):
   - Mentions: Texas Instruments **LM5155**
   - Topology: SEPIC (a form of buck-boost)
   - Performance requirement: ~1 MHz switching for >75 kHz bandwidth

**Analysis**:
- LM34936: Buck-boost controller, typical for this application
- LM5155: Wide VIN controller, also capable, but different topology
- Cannot use both - must be one or the other
- Component values and PCB layout differ significantly between choices

**Resolution Path**:
1. Check schematic for actual part used
2. If schematic unclear, make engineering decision based on:
   - Performance requirements (bandwidth, efficiency)
   - Component availability
   - Cost
   - PCB layout complexity
3. Update ALL documentation with chosen controller
4. Verify all component values match chosen controller

**Impact**:
- Affects: TX-ARCHITECTURE.md, EER-SUPPLY-DESIGN.md, POWER-ARCHITECTURE.md
- Affects: Schematic, PCB layout, BOM
- Affects: Firmware (register configuration, control loop)

**Status**: ‚è≥ UNRESOLVED - Awaiting schematic review

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Review schematic to identify actual controller used
- [ ] If LM34936: Update EER phase modulation.md reference, remove LM5155 mention
- [ ] If LM5155: Update Tx EER.md entirely, recalculate all component values
- [ ] Document resolution decision in this file
- [ ] Update affected architecture documents

**Related Documents**: Tx EER.md, EER phase modulation.md, TX-ARCHITECTURE.md (to be created), EER-SUPPLY-DESIGN.md (to be revised)

## Component Selection Notes

### RF Switches - Preselector and PA Tank

#### AS183-92LF (Preselector)
**Decision**: Use AS183-92LF for all preselector switching (inductors and capacitors)

**Rationale**:
- Documented use in preselector applications (Skyworks app notes)
- OFF-state voltage capability validated for tank circuits
- Quantity needed: 13 total (3 inductors + 8 capacitors + 2 fixed caps)
- Cost: ~$1.25 each = $16.25 total

**Alternative Considered**: AS169-73LF (cheaper at $0.85)
- Rejected due to: Unknown OFF-state voltage rating in tank circuit application
- Savings ($5.20 total) not worth risk of field failures

**Status**: ‚úÖ DECIDED

**Related Documents**: PRESELECTOR-DESIGN.md, RX-ARCHITECTURE.md

---

#### SMP1302-079LF (PA Tank Capacitor Switching)
**Decision**: Use SMP1302-079LF PIN diodes for PA tank capacitor switching

**Specification**:
- Breakdown voltage: 200V
- Suitable for hot-side topology
- Requires forward bias (~10mA) and reverse bias (+12V)

**Status**: ‚úÖ SPECIFIED in architecture docs

**Related Documents**: PA-TANK-DESIGN.md (to be created), EER phase modulation.md

---

### ADC Selection

#### AKM AK5578 (8-Channel Audio Codec)
**Decision**: Use AK5578 instead of originally considered TI audio codec

**Upgrade Rationale** (documented in "Update to 192kS/s for rx.md"):
- Sample rate: 192 kS/s (vs 96 kS/s originally)
- Channels: 8 available (need 6 for triple-QSD)
- Cost: Minimal increase vs original
- Benefits:
  - Relaxed preselector tuning (¬±100kHz vs ¬±50kHz tolerance)
  - Improved tuning step margins on 20m, 17m
  - Software compensation for preselector rolloff (elegant solution)

**Status**: ‚úÖ DECIDED and documented

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Merge "Update to 192kS/s for rx.md" into RX-ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Remove standalone update document after merge
- [ ] Verify AK5578 specifications in schematic

**Related Documents**: RX-ARCHITECTURE.md, Update to 192kS/s for rx.md

- Purpose: Adequate for +28 dBm survival (7.9V peak after clamp)
- Quantity: 8 (4 stages √ó 2 MOSFETs per stage)

**Status**: ‚úÖ SPECIFIED in Rx input Attenuator.md

**Related Documents**: ATTENUATOR-DESIGN.md (to be renamed)

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Triple-QSD Receiver Strategy
**Decision**: Three parallel quadrature sampling detectors with different characteristics

**Rationale**:
- QSD1: Standard quadrature (f-k), primary receiver
- QSD2: Standard quadrature (f+k), image rejection
- QSD3: Harmonic rejection (6-phase, 33.33% duty cycle at f), 3f nulling

**Combined Performance**:
- 3rd harmonic: >73 dB rejection (preselector + QSD3)
- Even harmonics: Theoretically infinite (QSD1/QSD2 null)
- Image rejection: Software combining of QSD1 and QSD2

**Status**: ‚úÖ DECIDED and well-documented

**Related Documents**: RX-ARCHITECTURE.md

---

### Preselector Q Factor Limitation
**Decision**: Q ‚â§ 20 across all bands

**Rationale**:
- Switch protection: Limits tank voltage to safe levels
- With Q=30: 237V peak at survival input (risky for AS183-92LF)
- With Q=20: 158V peak without clamp, 48V peak with Schottky clamp
- Trade-off: Only 2.6 dB less 3rd harmonic rejection vs Q=30
- Combined system (preselector + QSD3) still achieves >70 dB total rejection

**Status**: ‚úÖ DECIDED and documented with analysis

**Related Documents**: RX-ARCHITECTURE.md, PRESELECTOR-DESIGN.md (to be created)

---

### LPF Array Consolidation
**Decision**: Six filters instead of eight (consolidate bands)

**Consolidation Strategy**:
- Filter 1: 160m only
- Filter 2: 80m + 60m
- Filter 3: 40m + 30m
- Filter 4: 20m + 17m
- Filter 5: 15m only (needs good 2f rejection at 42 MHz)
- Filter 6: 12m + 10m

**Benefits**:
- Component savings: $13 per transceiver (~25% reduction)
- All bands still meet >60 dBc harmonic rejection target

**Status**: ‚úÖ DECIDED and documented

**Related Documents**: Transmitter Low-Pass Filter Array.txt (to be renamed LPF-ARRAY-DESIGN.md)

---

### 200Œ© Internal LPF Impedance
**Decision**: Use 200Œ© internal filter impedance with autotransformer matching

**Rationale**:
- Higher voltage (100V RMS vs 50V RMS at 50W)
- Lower current (0.5A RMS vs 1A RMS)
- Improved component Q
- Reduced capacitor stress (fewer parallel caps needed)
- Lower insertion loss (~0.1 dB improvement)
- Integrated matching (no separate transformers)

**Status**: ‚úÖ DECIDED and documented

**Related Documents**: Transmitter Low-Pass Filter Array.txt

**Current Application Complexity**:
- Real-time ADC/DAC streaming
- USB Ethernet networking (lwIP stack)
