**Core**: FT140-43
**Primary**: 16 turns #18 AWG (200Ω side)
**Secondary**: 8 turns #18 AWG (50Ω side)

Winding method (recommended):
1. Wind 8 turns of both wires together (bifilar)
2. Continue primary wire alone for 8 more turns
3. Mark and connect appropriately

This gives good coupling while maintaining separate windings.

**Connections**:

Primary (16 turns):
  Input Hot: W1 start
  Input Ground: W1 end
  
Secondary (8 turns):
  Output Hot: W2 start
  Output Ground: W2 end

W1 and W2 are coupled magnetically through the core.
There are NO electrical connections between W1 and W2.

Turns ratio: 16:8 = 2:1
Impedance ratio: (2)² = 4:1 ✓
